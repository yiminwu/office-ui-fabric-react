              The MarqueeSelection component provides a service which allows the user to drag a rectangle to be drawn around
              items to select them. This works in conjunction with a selection object, which can be used to generically store selection state, separate from a component that consumes the state.
            </p>
            <p>
              MarqueeSelection also works in conjunction with the AutoScroll utility to automatically scroll the container when we drag a rectangle within the vicinity of the edges.
            </p>
            <p>
              When a selection rectangle is dragged, we look for elements with the <b>data-selection-index</b> attribute populated. We get these elements' boundingClientRects and compare them with the root's rect to determine selection state. We update the selection state appropriately.
            </p>
            <p>
              In virtualization cases where items that were once selected are dematerialized, we will keep the item in its
              previous state until we know definitively if it's on/off. (In other words, this works with List.)
