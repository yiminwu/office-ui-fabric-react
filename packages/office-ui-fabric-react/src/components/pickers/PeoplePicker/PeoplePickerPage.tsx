          <div>The PeoplePicker is used to select one or more entities, such as people or groups. Entry points for PeoplePickers are typically specialized TextField-like input fields known as a "well", which are used to search for recipients from a list. When a recipient is selected from the list, it is added to the well as a specialized Persona that can be interacted with or removed. Clicking on a Persona from the well should invoke a PersonaCard or open a profile pane for that recipient.</div>
