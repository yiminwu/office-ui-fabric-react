For change request files, you need to use the `rush` tool. You can globally install it:

```
npm i -g @microsoft/rush
```

To generate a file, you simply run:

```
rush change
```

This will ask you questions about your change and create a json file under the `common/changes` folder. The comments you include in the file will show up in the public changelog notes, so please follow the existing conventions. Commit this file and include it in your PR.
